        <h1>Hamburger Casserole</h1>
        <img src="../odin-recipes-photos/hamburger_casserole.jpg">
        <h4>My grandmother's hamburger casserole is classic comfort food! Featuring ground beef, noodles, and a creamy cheese sauce, this simple recipe dates back to the 1940's. You can tweak the amount of cheese and sour cream depending on what you've got in the fridge â€” it'll still turn out great!</h4>
